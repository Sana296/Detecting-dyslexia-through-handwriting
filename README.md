# Detecting-dyslexia-through-handwriting
Dyslexia is a language-based neurocognitive learning disorder that affects how 
people learn to read accurately and quickly and how they learn to spell. As a result 
of weaknesses in the phonological component of language, individuals with 
dyslexia struggle to associate spoken language with the written word. Difficulty 
decoding words accurately and fluently can also affect reading and vocabulary 
development.  
Traditional diagnostic tools and tests have focused on behavioral elements, such as 
literacy and memory proficiency, and have also included intelligence tests, which 
are generally standardized tests, but these tests can be time-consuming.  
Since children with dyslexia have irregular handwriting and reversed letters, this 
feature (reversed letters) helped us consider a new way to predict dyslexia: using 
images of handwriting.  
In this research, we attempted to take our own deep learning approach to predicting 
dyslexia. Our method leverages the power of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) 
to detect distinctive features in images of handwriting and classify patients based on 
them.
